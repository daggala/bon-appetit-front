This is a recipe app that helps people be able to trust their recipes - no more worrying if your recipe is lying to you or that you're going to mess it up! The app offers users to post their own recipes and to rate other user's recipes.

The app is written in Javascript (React using the Next.js SSR framework), styled-components and Material-ui component library.

The backend is written in Elixir by Cl√©ment Uster.

The file `_document.jsx` is there to help material-ui and SSR to work together. [See guides on material-ui official site](https://material-ui.com/guides/server-rendering/)
