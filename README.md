# Bon Appetit - WIP

I am the only developer of this project so I haven't made any efforts yet to write tests, implement storybook or types. I wanted to get this up and running with minimum efforts. Before adding more features to this app (comments and rating system), I plan to refactor it and add tests, typescript & storybook.

## What does this app do ?

This is app is stil in progress and it's title "Bon Appetit" is only temporary pet name. The final result is supposed to be recipe app, a little similar to the French marmiton with some additional features aiming to reduce food waste.

## Stack

The app is written in Javascript (React using the Next.js SSR framework for SEO purposes), styled-components and Material-ui component library.

The backend is in another repo. It's written in Node.js, using Express and Sequalize.

## Redesign

The application is undergoing massive redesign. Here's an example of one of the screenshots:

## Other

The file `_document.jsx` is there to help material-ui and SSR to work together. [See guides on material-ui official site](https://material-ui.com/guides/server-rendering/)
